-- Note: Some pathfinding jank seems to make the character torso have collision for some reason so the zombie might sometimes get flung, just reset and re-execute if that happens

-- needed hats: 451220849, 62724852, 48474294, 63690008, 62234425, 376548738, 617605556 (if youre missing any the script will notify you)

-- Commands (Prefix ">"): 
-- bring: brings zombie to you 
-- range <num>: sets zombie's new attack range (default 80)
-- idle: puts zombie into idle mode (really glitchy, only used it for debugging)
